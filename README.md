# Graph Convolutional Networks for Anomaly Detection in Financial Graphs
In this project I carried out at EURECOM university, in collaboration with the research department and a major player in the IT and data market, I have carried out:
- A deep theoretical analysis of Graph Convolutional Networks
- A research on the pitfalls of anomaly detection on huge graphs (like financial graphs)
- The implementation of a solution of non-trivial problem of minibatching during GCN training.    

In this repository you can also find my report, concerning the whole analysis and research I carried out ("GCN__AnomDetect_EURECOM.pdf").
